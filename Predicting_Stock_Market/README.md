We'll be using historical data on the price of the S&P500 Index to make predictions about future prices. Predicting whether an index will go up or down will help us forecast how the stock market as a whole will perform. Since stocks tend to correlate with how well the economy as a whole is performing, it can also help us make economic forecasts. We'll be using this dataset to develop a predictive model. We'll train the model with data from 1950-2012, and try to make predictions from 2013-2015.
